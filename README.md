The QuickCloud app allows you to quickly transfer data from device to device. The way it works is very simple:

you create a cloud where you put all the information you need (it can be text, files and photos)
you write down the ID of the cloud, which you will receive after creation. It is important not to lose this ID, otherwise you will not be able to access the data
from another device go to qu1ckcloud.com, enter your Cloud ID and get all your information.
